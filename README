As an input you have several entities, so called "creatives". Each of them has 
   - price 
   - id of advertiser 
   - country name to serve (optional)

Please implement a function auction, receiving 
   - array of creatives
   - number of winners
   - country name (optional)
and returning winner creatives, obeying the following rules:

1) all winners must have unique advertiser id
2) if third argument (country) is provided, then only creatives without country or creatives with same country can be among winners
3*) function should not give preference to any of equal by price creatives, but should return such creatives equiprobable.

Please cover your solution with tests.

* Consider a case with several input creatives equal by price and several function calls with same input, output results may be different.
